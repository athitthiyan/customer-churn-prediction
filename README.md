## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset containing customer demographics, services, and account information.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation

## Key Insights
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability.

## Results
Model performance metrics are saved in `outputs/results/model_metrics.txt`.

## Visualizations
Churn distribution plot is saved in `outputs/figures/churn_distribution.png`.
